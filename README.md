# Various-DQN-algorithms-in-pytorch
Self implemented DQN algorithms. It uses Pytorch as it's deep learning tool. 

Main part of the DQN algorithm is defined by one class in a file main.py.

This class is customizable so it may fit to various environments with descrete action space. 

Some very common libraries must be pre-installed to run the algorithm. See requirements.txt.
